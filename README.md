# MIMIC-project_kNN_SVM_NN

The dataset comes from MIMIC project (https://mimic.physionet.org/). MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

You can find 2 different projects in this repository:
- Predicting the probability of death ("HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG") using k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines
- Predicting the length of stay ("LOS") using a Neural Network
